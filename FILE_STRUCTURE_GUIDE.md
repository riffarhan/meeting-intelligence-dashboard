## 🚀 Three Ways to Deploy

### Method 1: Automated Setup (Easiest!)

#### On Mac/Linux:
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x setup.sh

# Run the script
./setup.sh
```

#### On Windows:
```cmd
# Double-click setup.bat
# OR run in Command Prompt:
setup.bat
```

**The script will:**
- ✅ Initialize Git
- ✅ Rename files properly
- ✅ Create missing files
- ✅ Commit everything
- ✅ Push to GitHub
- ✅ Give you next steps

---

### Method 2: GitHub Desktop (Visual)

1. **Download GitHub Desktop**: https://desktop.github.com/

2. **Create Repository**:
   - File → New Repository
   - Name: `meeting-intelligence-dashboard`
   - Local Path: Choose where your files are
   - Click "Create Repository"

3. **Add Files**:
   - Rename `bonus_quest_complete.py` → `app.py`
   - Copy all files to the repository folder
   - GitHub Desktop shows all new files

4. **Commit & Push**:
   - Write commit message: "Initial commit"
   - Click "Commit to main"
   - Click "Publish repository"
   - Choose public or private
   - Click "Publish"

5. **Deploy to Streamlit**:
   - Go to https://streamlit.io/cloud
   - Sign in with GitHub
   - Click "New app"
   - Select your repository
   - Main file: `app.py`
   - Click "Deploy"

---

### Method 3: Command Line (Manual)

```bash
# 1. Rename main file
mv bonus_quest_complete.py app.py

# 2. Initialize Git
git init

# 3. Add all files
git add .

# 4. Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Meeting Intelligence Dashboard"

# 5. Create repo on GitHub (https://github.com/new)
# Then connect it:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/meeting-intelligence-dashboard.git

# 6. Push
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Then deploy on Streamlit Cloud (see Method 2, step 5).

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" error
**Fix**: Check that package is in `requirements.txt`

### "Permission denied" on setup.sh
**Fix**: Run `chmod +x setup.sh` first
